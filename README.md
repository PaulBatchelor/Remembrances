# Rembrances

By Paul Batchelor

"Remembrances" is an intervention on one of the CCRMA
staircases. Primarily a sound installation, it is built out of six Raspberry Pi computers
and speakers, which produce six sources of audio. The musical arrangment
uses the 13-note Bohlen-Pierce scale for tonality, and includes computer generated
whispered speech. The text used by the speech is a modified version of the five
remembrances, a staple in Buddhist literature and pratice:

You are of the nature to grow old. There is no way to escape growing old.

You are of the nature to have ill health. There is no way to escape ill health.

You are of the nature to die. There is no way to escape death.

All that is dear to you and everyone you love are of the nature to change.
There is no way to escape being separated from them.

Your actions are your only true belongings. You cannot escape the consequences
of your actions. Your actions are the ground upon which you stand.
